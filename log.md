# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed my App for the Freshworks co<div> Hackathon. It is a MS OneNote - Freshservice Integration application.

**Thoughts** This was an amazing experience. I was concerned that I wasn't going to have enough time to finish the project. But with 45 minutes to spare, I finally was able to get the app to work. Submitted my project and called it a day.

### Day 2: June 06, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working my way through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects. First project in the line-up is a Tribute Page. Picked Steve Yzerman, and began the layout of the page using HTML and CSS. I also created a Trello Board for my 100DaysOfCode journey. 

**Thoughts** These projects are a great place to start to add some content to my resume. But the truth is I am not much of a designer. I much prefer creating applications that use functional programming. But I really need to work on just the basics for a little while.
