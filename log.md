# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: June 22, Monday

**Today's Progress** I learned how to pull fronts from external sources using CSS.

**Thoughts** I used to believe that I needed to buy and download all of my fonts, but not anymore.

### Day 5: June 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress** I've been stuck on the same CSS problem for a few days now:

<//style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
<//style>

<//h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp<//h2>
<//main>
  <//p class="red-text">Click here to view more <//a href="#">cat photos<//a>.<//p>

I've been try to solve the problem by inserting <//h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp<//h2> as it's own line outside of the style tag until I realized that my problem was within the style tag itself. The challenge was to change the color of the h2 tag text from 

<//style//>
.blue-text {
    color: blue;
 }
 <//style//>
 
  to 
  
<//style//>
.red-text {
    color: red; 
}
<//style//>

After I finished a few code challenges, I practiced a little more CSS with codepip to play "Flexbox Froggy" which I hear is a great way to learn/practice CSS. I'm having a lot of fun and advise anyone else trying to learn CSS to try codepip out as well.

**Thoughts** I was excited to realize that it was a simple fix and move on to my next challenge. This problem made me realize that it is super easy to over look the smallest problems and that will throw you off and bring you to a stand still. I read through the instructions multiple times and couldn't make perfect sence of what I needed to do but luckily I was allowed to try as many times as I needed until I figured out the right solution.

### Day 4: June 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Today I started my challenge on CSS. So far I've learned that CSS can be used for customizing the:

color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions

of a project. The customizations could be used as inline styles or external styles. Inline style CSS is found in the HTML and is designed for changing lines of code or blocks of code. External CSS styles are often used by developers as the desired preference to inline because it looks cleaner and more organized since it's not mixed in with any HTML.

**Thoughts** freecodecamp's CSS modules are buggy. I continued to fail the same test until I turned off my chrome's Dark reader extension.



### Day 3: June 15, Monday

**Today's Progress** I completed the Basics HTML/HTML5 challenges on freecodecamp and learned about Nesting elements and organizing HTML pages using HTML tags, head, div, body, and DOCTYPE... Every html file needs to begin with a DOCTYPE for it to translate between newer and older computer systems. DOCTYPE html is commonly used for HTML5 files. Part of the challenge today was to create a form that could be submitted to a server after choosing a responses form a list of options in the forms of radio buttons and checkboxes. I took all the information I learned today to create my very own submission for for people to list things they love and hate and to submit a form with their name and sex (male/female). I'll be adding more features tomorrow but I'm excited to push what I have up to Github.

I started the day off looking through Team Armadillo's Trello and pushed some acklog to 'Done' and got with Zach to set deadlines for items we needed to spend less time on to expidite the move into the next stages of projects we plan to work on. I looked over Agile Scrum with Ojo today and started the CSS challenges for the next phase of my #100daysofcode challenges.



**Thoughts** Being that this is my second go-round starting the #100daysofcode challenge, there's a different air to doing it this time than there was last time. I don't want to get too long winded with this entry but to anyone reading this and unsure how to get started with their #100daysofcode challege, start a group and have fun! Going through the challenges alone as a newbie is not as fulfilling as going through it with a group of people who you can learn with.

### Day 2: June 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress** I continued my challenges with Basic HTML/HTML5 and learned how to nest internal and external links within text and images. The modules also went over how to create links that direct the user to open links into new tabs in their browser. I ended the lessons on creating empty links (I forgot the technical term already lol): a href="#" and unordered lists (ul) and ordered lists (ol). 

I worked on two code katas with Zach today on codewars. We completed Function 1 - hello world! and Is the string uppercased. 
    

 
**Thoughts** With all the coding I've done today, I've been exposed to the fact that there really are a lot of different ways to find the solutions to different problems in code and I'm excited to earn more ways to solve more complex problems down the road.

### Day 1: June 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today, I started my 100-Days-of-Code challenge. Today's challenge was to utilize basic HTML/HTML5 elements to build a simple webpage for a CatPhotosApp. I started with learning the use of different tag elements:
    + h tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
    + p tags (always a lowercase p)
    + img src="" (img tags are self closing)
    + a tags (anchor tags)
    

 
**Thoughts** I'm excited to be redoing my coding challenge again and being more accountable to it this time around. My goal is to FINISH! Of course my goal is to learn, but I believe the most important thing is to stick to the challenge and finish because working on these challenges, there's no way a person wouldn't learn anything. I like the usability of the in-browser IDE.
