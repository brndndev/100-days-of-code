# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today, I started my 100-Days-of-Code challenge. Today's challenge was to utilize basic HTML/HTML5 elements to build a simple webpage for a CatPhotosApp. I started with learning the use of different tag elements:
    + <h1></h1>
    + <h2></h2>
    + <h3></h3>
    + <h4></h4>
    + <h5></h5>
    + <h6></h6>
    + <p></p>
    + <img src=""> <!-- img tags are self closing -->
    + <a href=""></a>
    

 
**Thoughts** I'm excited to be redoing my coding challenge again and being more accountable to it this time around. My goal is to FINISH! Of course my goal is to learn, but I believe the most important thing is to stick to the challenge and finish because working on these challenges, there's no way a person wouldn't learn anything. I like the usability of the in-browser IDE.
