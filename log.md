# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed my App for the Freshworks co<div> Hackathon. It is a MS OneNote - Freshservice Integration application.

**Thoughts** This was an amazing experience. I was concerned that I wasn't going to have enough time to finish the project. But with 45 minutes to spare, I finally was able to get the app to work. Submitted my project and called it a day.
