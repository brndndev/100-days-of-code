# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: June 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress** I continued my challenges with Basic HTML/HTML5 and learned how to nest internal and external links within text and images. The modules also went over how to create links that direct the user to open links into new tabs in their browser. I ended the lessons on creating empty links (I forgot the technical term already lol): a href="#" and unordered lists (ul) and ordered lists (ol). 

I worked on two code katas with Zach today on codewars. We completed Function 1 - hello world! and Is the string uppercased. 
    

 
**Thoughts** With all the coding I've done today, I've been exposed to the fact that there really are a lot of different ways to find the solutions to different problems in code and I'm excited to earn more ways to solve more complex problems down the road.

### Day 1: June 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today, I started my 100-Days-of-Code challenge. Today's challenge was to utilize basic HTML/HTML5 elements to build a simple webpage for a CatPhotosApp. I started with learning the use of different tag elements:
    + h tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
    + p tags (always a lowercase p)
    + img src="" (img tags are self closing)
    + a tags (anchor tags)
    

 
**Thoughts** I'm excited to be redoing my coding challenge again and being more accountable to it this time around. My goal is to FINISH! Of course my goal is to learn, but I believe the most important thing is to stick to the challenge and finish because working on these challenges, there's no way a person wouldn't learn anything. I like the usability of the in-browser IDE.
